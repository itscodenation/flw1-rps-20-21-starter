# Rock Paper Scissors Project
## Browser preview command: python3 -m http.server 3000

## Overview: 
In this unit, coders will create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The Rock, Paper, Scissors game will take user choice, generate a computer choice, and display the winner to the screen. To create this project, coders will use jQuery to take user input and display data, the Math Library to generate a random choice, and conditionals to determine the winner.

- [ ] Outside of your click handler, declare the variables you'll need to track the user choice, computer choice and winner and assign them values of empty strings.
- [ ] Outside of your click handler, declare a randomNumber variable and set it equal to 0
- [ ] In your click handler, generate a random number and assign it to the randomNumber variable
- [ ] In your click handler, store the input value in a variable	
- [ ] In your click handler, display user input to the screen
#### Wrap
- [ ] Push your changes!

## Day 3

## JavaScript
- [ ] Write a conditional statement which, given the number range of randomNumber, assigns ‘rock’, ‘paper’ or ‘scissors’ to the computer choice  variable 
- [ ] Display the computer choice to the screen
- [ ] Write a  statement that compares the userChoice to the computerChoice to determine the winner of the game
- [ ] Display the winner to the screen in a div
- [ ] Clear the input value once a result is displayed
