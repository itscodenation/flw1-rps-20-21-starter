# Rock Paper Scissors Project

## Overview: 
In this unit, coders will create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. To create this project, coders will use JavaScript to take user input, use the Math Library to pick a random computer choice, and use conditionals to determine the winner.

## Day 1

#### Planning
- [ ] Copy the [project planning document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CCzFGH6Z4AtpWrDuB6KQK73N5-8ywGv0KhO10i3hZPk/edit#) and link a completed version in your ReadMe.
#### Set-Up
- [x] Go to the repository at https://github.com/itscodenation/rockpaperscissors
- [ ] Fork this repository to your Github account and pull it down to Glitch
- [ ] Add, commit, and push your changes
- [ ] Make your site live on gh-pages

### JavaScript
- [ ] Use JavaScript to display the value of the input on the page


### HTML and CSS
- [ ] Add any more HTML elements you will need to the page
- [ ] Customize your HTML with CSS

#### Wrap
- [ ] Push your changes!
- [ ] Save and submit your website using the link on the session agenda.

## Day 2

### Javascript 

- [ ] Outside of your click handler, declare the variables you'll need to track the user choice, computer choice and winner and assign them values of empty strings.
- [ ] Outside of your click handler, declare a randomNumber variable and set it equal to 0
- [ ] When the user initiates the game, generate a random number and assign it to the randomNumber variable.
- [ ] When the user initiates the game, store the user choice..	
- [ ] When the user initiates the game, display user choice to the screen
#### Wrap
- [ ] Push your changes!

## Day 3

## JavaScript
- [ ] Write a conditional statement which, given the number range of randomNumber, assigns ‘rock’, ‘paper’ or ‘scissors’ to the variable that holds the computer choice. 
- [ ] Display the computer choice to the screen
- [ ] Write a  statement that compares the user choice to the computer choice to determine the winner of the game
- [ ] Display the winner to the screen.
- [ ] Clear the input value once a result is displayed.

#### Wrap
- [ ] Push your changes!

## Projects Extensions:
- [ ] Designed to fit the developer's personality
- [ ] Validates input so that it will return “Not valid input” if the user types in a wrong choice. 
- [ ] Accepts any form of a word regardless of capitalization (i.e. “Rock” “rock” roCk”)
- [ ] Keeps track of total wins and losses, until the page refreshes. 
- [ ] Allows for more variety in throwing options. Example: [Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock)
